Test #2
PURPOSE
The purpose of this test is to test your color design skill. You will be given a dark-black theme color and you need to change it to a light-blue theme.

Hints: Do NOT simply change the background. You need to ensure all the colors are matching and easy with the eyes. Therefore, if you need to use white and blue, you are welcome to do so.

INSTRUCTIONS
Download the following zip file containing the look and feel HTML and CSS.
Then unzip and put it into a folder (eg. C:\Temp\WebTheme).
Open MyProfile.html.
Please change the look and feel of MyProfile.html from a dark-black theme color to a light-blue theme color.
NOTE: Light-blue theme color means the background must be a LIGHT background and the foreground (font-color) must be a DARK color.
In this test, we are testing your color matching capability. Our recommendation is to google Light Theme UI Design and click on Images to get inspiration on the theme color. Please take the time to complete this task.
For your convenience, we have split out the color to separate CSS files that only contain color definitions.
You will need to change the following CSS files:
../Contents/Styles/site.theme.robotic.dark-1.0.0.css
../Contents/Styles/site.theme.robotic.dark.state.loggedin-1.0.0.css
../Contents/Styles/bootstrap/bootstrap.theme.robotic.dark-1.0.0.css
../Contents/Styles/xcify/xcify.guis.inputicongroup.theme.robotic.dark-1.0.0.css
../Contents/Styles/xcify/member/myprofile.theme.robotic.dark-1.0.0.css
